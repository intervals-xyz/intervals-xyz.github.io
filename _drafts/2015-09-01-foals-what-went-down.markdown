Some years ago I used to believe that Foals were good because they used saxophones in their arrangements. Back then, my knowledge of them was limited to the wildly popular _Cassius_ and _Balloons_, shown to me by friends who casually heard them in an episode of _Skins_.

Of course, I used to say that I loved Foals, even if I hadn't bothered at all to listen to some more of them. Their second album, _Total Life Forever_ was already out. We're talking 2011 here. I am deeply ashamed to say that I didn't even try listening to more of their songs until around last year or so, when _My Number_ started playing on the radio. I found myself unconsciously dancing to that song.

And that's because the song is awfully good. In fact, the whole of 2013's _Holy Fire_ might be considered one of the best albums of the decade so far, at least in terms of indie rock, or whatever rock has morphed into nowadays (half of you might have stopped reading by now). The album has some quirks, of course; the first that comes to mind is the flow between songs. However, you can't expect smooth _DSOtM_-style transitions between songs nowadays, unless you're listening to Metronomy in _The English Riviera_ (yes, I mean that transition. The rest of you can leave now). The decline of the album format as an artistic medium in itself and for-itself as a self-nihilating nothingness is best left for another post, however.

Nonetheless, when you listen to the songs themselves, you just can't help being moved: it might be physically, or it might be emotionally. Take the aforementioned _My Number_, with its unfair amount of flow, perfectly stabilized by curious lyrics and sweet-sour instrumentation; or take the incidentally very nocturnal _Late Night_, pretty adequate for introspection (this word will become important later on). Need some aggression? Take a listen to _Inhaler_. Want some of that not-quite-EDM-but-almost that only Foals can do without sounding ridiculous? _Milk & Black Spiders_.

You might ask why I'm talking about _Holy Fire_ if this is a review for _What Went Down_. I will be direct. _What Went Down_ cannot stand on its own without some help from the band's back catalog, especially _Holy Fire_. To be honest, if this was their debut, I would completely pass on it. Maybe appreciate it a tiny little bit, acknowledge its professionalism, just like I did with _Modern Vampires of the City_. Sure, it's good, but meh.

I will show you. Get off the Internet for an hour, grab your cans, set _What Went Down_, and truly listen. Stop reading this review, you'd finish it before the third song. Get off Facebook (preferably permanently!), turn the TV off. Imagine yourself in 1989, lying on your couch, the very dim light of a winter's afternoon hardly leaking through the living room window, the rain a dim background to The Cure's _Disintegration_: that's what you're aiming for. Show some respect, this is how music **must** be listened to.
